🎓 I am currently a PhD Student at the [Department of Economics and Business Economics at Aarhus University](https://econ.au.dk/). 

📖 My research interests lie in the areas of labor and educational economics, as well as applied microeconometrics. In particular, I am interested in the effects of student aid on social mobility and potential labor market outcomes.
